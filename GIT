 Why Version Control ??

 Have you ever:

● Made a change to code, realised it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?
● Lost code and didn’t have a backup of that code ?
● Had to maintain multiple versions of a product ?
● Wanted to see the difference between two (or more) versions of your code ?
● Wanted to prove that a particular change in code broke application or fixed a application ?
● Wanted to review the history of some code ?
● Wanted to submit a change to someone else's code ?
● Wanted to share your code, or let other people work on your code ?
● Wanted to see how much work is being done, and where, when and by whom ?
● Wanted to experiment with a new feature withou


In these cases, and no doubt others, a version control system should make your life easier.
